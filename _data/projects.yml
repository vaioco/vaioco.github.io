  desc: ARTDroid is a framework for hooking virtual-methods calls supporting the latest Android runtime (ART). 
      A virtual-method is called by the ART runtime using a dispatch table (vtable). 
      ARTDroid can tamper the vtable without any modifications to both Android framework and appâ€™s code.
      The ARTDroid hooking framework can be used to build an efficient sandbox on real devices and monitor
      sensitive methods called in both Java reflection and JNI ways.
